I am an experienced economic policy researcher at a Washington, DC based think tank. My research areas and interests include aging and long-term care, health economics, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, fiscal policy, household bargaining models, agent-based modelling, and drug policy. I have a master's degree in economics and a strong mathematical and coding background.
